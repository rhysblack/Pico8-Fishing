# Pico8-Fishing
A small game made in Pico8
The full game is in the non demo folder. The .p8 file is the code for the game, and the exports folder contains a .zip file which contains the web export and a .bin folder which contains the .exe exports.
For the web export, download the 'grab_fishing.zip' file, export it, then open the index page in a browser to play.
For the .bin folder you can download and extract the correct version for your operating system. After extracting you should have a .exe file which can be used to play the game.
